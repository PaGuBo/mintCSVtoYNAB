[Amazon.com](http://amzn.to/2j9L3xa) can appear a few dozen times on a credit card statement, 
making it very difficult to properly categorize the transaction in [YNAB Classic](http://classic.youneedabudget.com/). 

This script is a quick and dirty way to help with that, but you need to jump through a few hoops.

1. Use the amazon store card. This will show the purchased items right on the statement.
2. Connect the Synchrony Bank account to [mint.com](https://mint.intuit.com). 
The reason you need to do that is because the bank doesn't allow the download of up-to-date transactions.
3. Download the transaction from mint, and run them through this script.
4. The new file will be property formatted to go into YNAB, making categorization easier.
